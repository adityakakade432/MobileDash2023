System Description 
The Mobile Dashboard is a mobile application that is used to dispaly statistics about the electric vehicle. This dashboard is mainly used by team members and the driver during competition to view data about the vechile's current performance. The purpose of the Mobile Dashboard is to keep track of the various details of the car in a user intuitive format as it runs so that the driver can be aware the car's metrics. This dashboard will also send the collected data of the car's metrics to the Historical Dashboard so that it can be further analyzed to improve performance.

The infomration displayed on the Mobile Dashboard is broken down into three categories. The most far left widget displays the current speed the car is traveling at in miles per hour. The number will reflect any changes as the car speeds or slows down. The next widget to the right displays various metrics relating to the car's power. The top widget in this column is the vehicle's power in kilowatts per hour. The next widget down displays the battery power as a percentage while the last widget displays the connection status of the dashboard to the DAQ. Finally, the farthest right widget is a map that tracks the car's positions during the race. All of this data comes from the DAQ.

The frontend of the Mobile Dashboard was implemented using React Native (with a focus on Android usage), which combines the use of HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
